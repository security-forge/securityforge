### $~WHOAMI

Hi there, my name is Harry. I am an information security professional with an interest in almost all aspects of this industry. My skill set would put me as a blue teamer, but you cannot defend against that which you do not know, so I am working on improving my red team knowledge as well.

I graduated with a degree Honours Bachelor of Applied Information Sciences (Information Systems Security) from Sheridan College (yes, it's really that long of a title). Degrees aren't everything of course. But, the four years I spent at school laid a foundation of security knowledge that I have been able to apply and expand immediately in the working world. Plus, it seriously helped me improve my google-fu.

Outside of my passion for information security, I love all things music (metalhead checking in), the great outdoors, and gaming. So expect to see posts about all of those topics.

### $~WORK EXP

Right now I work on an endpoint security operations team. What that means is I help ensure each an every endpoint (workstations & servers) have all our different EDR/AV/security tools installed and running. On top of that, I work with our other security teams (SOC, Threat Hunters, Policy teams) to improve all our endpoint security software configurations in order to reduce false positives, add functionality, improve performance, etc... 

In a previous job I was working to enhance and build out new features for the companies SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) platform. What this means is; I worked with other security teams to help build out a case management structure that fits their needs. Once completed, we worked together to find pain points in their process that can solved through the use of automation. This role has taught me a lot about programming, how to effectively communicate, and the importance of structure when dealing with security incidents.

Before that, I was working with the same company on a pilot project to implement a deception platform within our network. The goal was to provide high-fidelity alerts with low false positives rates. Additionally, it provided extra defenses around the companies most important assets (crown jewels).

### $~MISC.

If you would like to talk to me about anything, feel free to reach out via twitter or email. Please keep in mind I am still new to this industry so I may not have all the answers. If you happen to have a lot more experience than me and are willing to be a mentor, please reach out as well. 

Thanks for reading!
